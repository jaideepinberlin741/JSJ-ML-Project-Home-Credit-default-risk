    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Influence Is Transparent**  \n",
    "  Features like `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `DAYS_BIRTH`, and `AMT_CREDIT` show clear directional impact on risk. For example, higher `EXT_SOURCE_2` scores consistently reduce predicted risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical Features Matter — But Require Care**  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Individual Explanations Build Trust**  \n",
    "  Force plots and waterfall plots (where successful) reveal which features push a prediction toward or away from default — enabling case-level auditability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Threshold Analysis Supports Business Decisions**  \n",
    "  By visualizing predicted probabilities and inspecting borderline cases, we can set risk thresholds that balance caution with opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Known Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some SHAP plots failed due to unencoded string features (e.g. `\"Cash loans\"`). Fixes are known and can be applied post-presentation.\n",
    "- SHAP’s newer APIs may conflict with LightGBM’s categorical handling — we used the stable `TreeExplainer` workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encode all categorical features before SHAP analysis  \n",
    "- Extend interpretability to fairness, calibration, and business rule overlays  \n",
    "- Use SHAP insights to refine model thresholds and improve stakeholder alignment\n",
